                        <p>A lifetime mortgage is a type of equity release - it's a loan secured against your home which lets you release money as a cash sum or a regular income over a fixed term.</p>
                        <p>
                            It is only repaid from the sale of your home when the last surviving borrower dies, or moves out of the home and into long-term care. A lifetime mortgage will reduce an inheritance and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits. Interest is charged on the loan plus any interest already added. This means the amount you owe will increase quickly over time. Arrangement fee may apply.

                        <p>
                            Before deciding to take out a lifetime mortgage, an adviser can talk you through the benefits and risks. And they can point out other options available to you. In the meantime, here are a few things to think about.
                        </p>
                        <ul style="line-height: 2em;">

                                A lifetime mortgage will reduce an inheritance. It may affect your entitlement to mean-tested benefits. You may have cheaper ways to borrow money.

                                You can take Inheritance Protection to protect a proportion of the value of your home. However, this will reduce the amount you can borrow.

                                We have a No Negative Equity Guarantee which means your beneficiaries will never have to pay back more than the amount your property is sold for.

                                You can choose to make Optional Partial Repayments, which will reduce the amount you owe and the total amount of interest charged over the duration of the lifetime mortgage. However, if you decide to repay all of your lifetime mortgage early, you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge.
