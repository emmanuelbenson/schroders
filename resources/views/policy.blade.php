                            You may have the option to choose an increasing policy, the premiums will increase in line with the changes in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) multiplied by 1.5 subject to a maximum increase of 15% per annum. The RPI provides an indication of inflation on a monthly basis. The RPI measures and tracks the average change in the purchase price of goods and services such as housing expenses and mortgage interest payments.

                        <p>
                            We are entitled to cancel the policy if any premiums are not paid within 30 days of their due date. If we cancel the policy , your cover will end and no further premiums will be payable. We will not refund any premiums already paid.

                            If the premium is paid annually and claim is paid, we will pay a pro-rata refund of the premium for the remaining months of that year. The policy will end when a claim is paid and no further premiums will be payable.

                        <p>
                            If you choose level cover the amount of cover will stay the same unless you change it using the options available in the section headed 'Changing your policy' during the period of cover.

                        <p>
                            If you choose decreasing cover the amount of cover will reduce during the period of cover. Decreasing cover is often used to help protect a repayment mortgage. We apply an interest rate to the original amount of cover to estimate the amount that you repay each month on your repayment mortgage and the amount you are covered for will decrease accordingly. If the interest rate we apply is less than the interest rate that is actually applied to your mortgage, or your mortgage changes, the amount we pay out may not be enough to repay your mortgage in full. The interest rate applied will be shown in your Policy Booklet. To ensure that the amount paid out will cover the amount of your outstanding mortgage you should check regularly that the interest rate applied to the policy is equal to or higher than the interest rate applied to your mortgage by your lender.

                            You may have the option to choose increasing cover, the amount of cover will increase in line with changes in inflation on each policy anniversary with no need to answer further questions about your health. The amount of cover, including any increases you have already accepted, will increase in line with the changes in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) over a 12 month period. If we cannot use the RPI, we will use an index comparable to the RPI instead. We will contact you at least three months before the policy anniversary to tell you what the increase in the amount of cover and premium will be. If the change in the RPI is less than or equal to 1% we will not increase the amount of cover. If the change in the RPI is more than 10% we will only increase the amount of cover by 10% per annum.

                            This is an advance payment of the amount of cover where the life insured has a terminal illness . Terminal illness is defined as a definite diagnosis by your hospital consultant of an illness that satisfies both of the following:

No terminal illness claim can be made after the death of the life insured . If decreasing cover is chosen the amount payable will be the amount of cover we calculate on the date that it is established that the life insured has met our definition of terminal illness.

                        <p>We may send you a claim form to complete and return to us. In order to assess your claim we will require different evidence depending on the type of claim you are making.</p>
                        <p>We may also ask for the Policy Booklet and any other documents we may reasonably require for the claim you are making.</p>

                        <p>Life Cover: The death certificate of the life insured</p>
                        <p>Terminal Illness Cover: Proof that the definition has been met</p>
                        <p>Waiver of Premium: Proof that the relevant incapacity definition has been met</p>

                        <h4 class="blue-text">WHO WE PAY THE COVER TO</h4>
                        <p>The amount of cover is paid to you.</p>
                        <p>
                            In most cases, this means that we will make payment directly to the legal owner of the policy, or if
                            that person is dead, to their personal representative (usually the executor named in their will or
                            appointed representative by the named executor with credible legal authentication). This also means that if
                            the policy has been placed in trust, we will make payment to the trustees, and if the policy has been
                            assigned, we will make payment to the assignees.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="blue-text">PAYMENT OF COVER</h4>
                        <p>We will pay a claim for any of the cover described in the section headed ‘What is covered’ as a lump sum. Cover can only be paid in pound sterling (GBP) to a bank account in the UK. If you wish to receive payments outside the UK, then arrangements for such transfers must be made at your own expense.</p>

                        <h5 class="blue-text">REPLACEMENT COVER</h5>
                        <p>If you choose to take out a joint life policy and one of the lives insured makes a valid claim under full cover as, defined in the section headed ‘What is covered ', you can request to continue cover for the other life insured as a new single life policy.</p>
                        <p>You must request this option within six months of a valid claim under full cover being paid.</p>
                        <p>What we need to process your request</p>
                        <ul style="line-height: 2em;">
                            <li>a) The consent of the life insured who hasn’t claimed under full cover, by completing and returning a replacement cover form issued by us , which includes a short questionnaire about the life insured’s health, medical history, residency and leisure activities.</li>
                            <li>b) If the life insured who hasn’t claimed under full cover, answers ‘yes’ to any of the questions in the replacement cover form, we will require you to complete a full application form in order to set up a single life policy. Where we undertake a full medical and lifestyle assessment, depending on the answers there may be circumstances where we may not be able to offer cover to the life insured.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>

                        <ul style="line-height: 2em;">
                            <li>a) The new single life policy will include the same cover as the original policy. We will not change the cover in any other way, other than making it a single life policy.</li>
                            <li>b) The amount of cover will be the same as the original policy. If Decreasing Life Insurance is chosen, the amount of cover will be the remaining amount of cover at the time a valid claim under full cover was paid on the original policy.</li>
                            <li>c) The term of the new policy will not extend beyond the life insured’s 70th birthday or one year after the policy expiry date , whichever is earlier.</li>
                            <li>d) The new single life policy will be subject to premiums, terms and conditions available at the time you make the change.</li>

                        <p>
                            You can cancel the policy at any time. Once the policy starts we will provide you with a notice of your right to cancel. If you cancel the policy within 30 days of receiving both the notice and the policy, we will refund any premiums paid. If you cancel the policy after 30 days, you will not get any money back. If you cancel the policy, the cover will end and no further premiums will be payable.
