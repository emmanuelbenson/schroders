                        <h4 class="blue-text">Why choose our Income Lifetime Mortgage?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Would you like to enjoy the occasional special night out, or even a weekend away in the country? Perhaps you’re looking to treat the grandkids? Our Income Lifetime Mortgage gives you that extra bit of cash each month.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A lifetime mortgage is a type of equity release, which is a loan secured against your home. Our Income Lifetime Mortgage could be right for you if you're looking to release some of the money tied up in your home to supplement your monthly income. It gives you a regular monthly income over a fixed term. You can choose to take the income over 10, 15, 20 or 25 years.

                        <p>
                            Before deciding to take out a lifetime mortgage, an adviser can talk you through the benefits and risks. And they can point out other options available to you. In the meantime, here are a few things to think about.
                        </p>
                        <ul style="line-height: 2em;">
                            <li>
                                <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign blue-text"></i>
                                Once the fixed income term comes to an end, the monthly income will stop, but interest will continue to roll up until the lifetime mortgage is repaid.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign blue-text"></i>
                                A lifetime mortgage will reduce an inheritance. You can take Inheritance Protection to protect a proportion of the value of your home. However, this will reduce the amount you can borrow.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                There may be cheaper ways to borrow money.

                                Taking an income may affect any means-tested benefits you receive.

                                We have a No Negative Equity Guarantee which means your beneficiaries will never have to pay back more than the amount your property is sold for.

                                The loan is repaid when the last borrower dies or moves out of the home into long-term care.

                            <li>

                                Interest is charged on the loan plus any interest already added. This means the amount you owe will increase quickly over time.

                                You can choose to make Optional Partial Repayments when your monthly income has stopped, which reduces the interest. However, if you decide to repay all of your lifetime mortgage early, you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge.
